We have explored blind estimation for wireless communications under new perspectives and using new techniques developed for seemingly unrelated problems. We have also identified other methods and extensions that can further improve the performance or usefulness of these techniques in blind equalization and beamforming.

First, we used known results and algorithms for phase retrieval and applied this knowledge into the blind beamforming problem. We adapted the convergence results of Wirtinger Flow to subgaussian vectors, extending the convergence guarantees that were established for the Gaussian case. We also used the convergence analysis of WF to establish a more aggressive stepsize, which in turn tackles the slow convergence of traditional gradient-descent CMA schemes. 

%RMO - RTR+RGD
Last but not least, we also developed a framework to use Riemannian Manifold optimization in source recovery problems, and to the best of our knowledge, is the first work using these techniques for CMA-based formulations. The generality of the manifold formulation, along with computational complexity comparable to gradient-descent schemes, makes Riemannian Optimization an interesting line of study for blind estimation applications.
