\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap:conclusion}

This thesis surveyed techniques to improve the performance and efficiency of deep neural networks for the task of MIMO CSI estimation. In Chapter~\ref{chap:sph_norm} we discussed the importance of data pre-processing techniques, and we showed the efficacy of our proposed spherical normalization technique. In Chapter~\ref{chap:markovnet}, we exploited the temporal correlation of the wireless channel, and we demonstrated the superior performance and efficiency of a deep differential encoder compared to recurrent neural networks. Finally, in Chapter~\ref{chap:p2d}, we presented two main contributions: an accurate estimator of the delay domain CSI based on sparse frequency domain pilots and a hetergeneous differential encoding network combining deep compressed sensing networks with autoencoders. We showed the accuracy of our pilot-based delay domain estimator, even under aggressive sparsity and noisy pilot estimates. Furthermore, we verified the improved performance of heterogeneous networks over homogeneous networks.
